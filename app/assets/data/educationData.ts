      I followed an intensive 6 months course to become a Full Stack JavaScript Developer at CodeYourFuture which is an organisation that teaches asylum seekers and refugees web Development and helps them to build their experience and communication skills  through highly qualified volunteer software engineers.!
      My graduation project was part of a team building a Digital Welcome Pack application for refugees in Glasgow. Our clients are representatives from the local refugee charity Refuweegee. The App is built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) using React, with a Node backend and MongoDB database. I worked on a variety of tasks in the front-end and back-end.
      As part of the course I built a portfolio of projects (both individual and team-based) including a small-scale website for a fictional museum, a MongoDB driven Blog system, and a React app to explore Beyonce’s songs and albums, and more.
